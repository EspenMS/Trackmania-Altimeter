### Code
The code used in this plugin is heavialy inspired by the [Speedometer](https://openplanet.dev/plugin/speedometer) plugin made by [Greep](https://openplanet.dev/u/89matt89).

### Textures
The original textures for this plugin is made by [Marek Cel](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Cel_84).
I have modified the backplate of the altimeter by removing some text elements and the callibration scale.

## Brains
2D, trigonometry, visual programming, translation and rotation is not my strong suit.

I almost gave up on getting this ready before the start of [Deep Dip 2](https://matcherino.com/tournaments/111501) when the pointers in the altimeter was rotating all over my screen.

Until I remembered that [Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman) has a great YouTube channel where he teaches aspects of visual programming. And I wasn't dissapointed! Even though he teaches [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) he explained exactly what I struggled with in this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9sgjuh-CBM).
